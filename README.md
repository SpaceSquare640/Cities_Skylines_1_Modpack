## Planning engine checks

The .NET Framework 3.5 check runner uses no third-party test framework. It compiles the production pure-data planning sources against the game assemblies configured by `Local.props` or `CITIES_SKYLINES_DIR`. If MSBuild is not on `PATH`, locate it with the Visual Studio Installer `vswhere.exe`. From this directory, run:

```text
$vswhere = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe"
$msbuild = & $vswhere -latest -products '*' -requires Microsoft.Component.MSBuild -find 'MSBuild\**\Bin\MSBuild.exe' | Select-Object -First 1
& $msbuild Tests\PlanningEngineChecks.csproj /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:ModsDir=
.\bin\PlanningEngineChecks\Release\PlanningEngineChecks.exe
```

The checks cover citizen-unit-to-people conversion, planning snapshot copy isolation, the stale-snapshot warning, the 3–6 distinct-lane creation rule, concrete proposal stop data, people totals and route-segment coverage, normalized endpoint pairing, missing directed return paths, and the current endpoint/pair search caps. Build output stays under `bin\`; the test project has no game Mods deployment target.

The Development build also offers selected proposal creation. It records the actual bus lane and world direction selected for each stop, then revalidates the snapshot build index, bus prefab, segment build indices, lane, stop position, anchorability, and line limits on the simulation thread. Creation is hidden from Release builds, starts disarmed, requires confirmation on each click, and accepts only proposals with 3–6 distinct stop lanes. A later simulation-frame check inspects stop-lane connections, the `LineNotConnected` flag, and `PathFailed` flags on segments adjacent to stops; it does not verify each route's full path.

If creation is refused for stop eligibility or build-index changes, the Development log records the individual conditions and the capture and current indices. The global build index is diagnostic during capture but is a strict creation guard. <!-- OpenAI-Codex -->

The Development content-manager entry identifies DevTool and warns that the development version can damage saves. <!-- OpenAI-Codex -->

The route graph still treats junction-connected segments as connected and does not model lane-level turns or TM:PE restrictions. A generated proposal and its asynchronous checks are a Development prototype, not proof that every line can run in a live game.

## Cloud build and release readiness

The `Automated_Public_Transport_Planning` branch owns this module's CI. The existing source-integrity workflow checks project metadata only; it does not compile the DLL or validate gameplay. The manual `transport-cloud-readiness.yml` workflow intentionally fails while an approved, authenticated source of matching game reference assemblies is unavailable. It does not accept a variable as proof that dependencies exist.

Required references are `mscorlib.dll`, `System.dll`, `System.Core.dll`, `System.Xml.dll`, `ICities.dll`, `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `ColossalManaged.dll`, and `UnityEngine.dll`. No reference DLLs are committed or redistributed by this change. Cloud compilation, planning checks, and direct per-module GitHub Release DLL attachments remain blocked pending a dependency provisioning decision. Releases must provide the mod DLL and necessary permitted files directly, without ZIP archives.

Automatic Development Workshop dispatch is disabled regardless of `WORKSHOP_DEV_AUTO_UPLOAD`. Workshop upload is a separately authorized local operation; this branch must not dispatch the Website upload workflow. No automatic public release is enabled.

### Diagnostic cloud compilation

`cloud-compile-test.yml` uses GitHub-hosted Windows and Visual Studio MSBuild located through `vswhere`. It performs a real `Rebuild` with `Configuration=Release`, `DevTools=true`, and an empty `ModsDir`. Both game-path properties point to a newly created empty directory under `RUNNER_TEMP`; the project safeguards and `NoStdLib` remain intact. Missing game assemblies are expected to produce a genuine nonzero build result. This diagnostic publishes no artifacts or releases and performs no Workshop operation. It runs manually or when this workflow file changes on this module branch; ordinary source pushes do not trigger it. This legacy project has no package restore or companion stage.

### Verified reference compilation update — 2026-10-31

The compile diagnostic now restores the approved encrypted reference bundle from fixed commit `7b8a5e7c10f2db84388e8dd8af2084f239957b13` in this repository using a sparse checkout. Only the restore step receives `CS1_GAME_REFERENCES_KEY`; the authenticated helper verifies the ciphertext and all eight file hashes before writing references under `RUNNER_TEMP/cs1-game-root`. MSBuild uses that isolated game root. The workflow asserts that the compiled module DLL and PDB both exist and are nonempty. The earlier empty-root diagnostic and unavailable-source descriptions above describe the previous setup; the manual readiness workflow is retained unchanged. No decrypted references or build outputs are uploaded, cached, or released. Ordinary source pushes still do not trigger this diagnostic.

### Development prereleases

Every push to this module branch or manual run now builds and publishes a unique `aptp-dev-<run_id>-<attempt>` prerelease. Only the module DLL, Development README, unchanged LICENSE, build-info.txt, Steam_Workshop_Link.txt and SHA256SUMS are transferred to an isolated publisher. Uploaded draft assets are checked for exact names, count, nonzero size and SHA-256 before publication. No PDB, game assemblies or public ZIP are attached. Prereleases are not marked Latest and are not gameplay acceptance. The earlier diagnostic-only trigger statements above describe historical setup.

### Planning checks gate and full-name releases

The cloud workflow now compiles and executes the eight existing planning-engine checks before asset preparation and publication. The .NET 3.5 test executable runs using an explicit cloud CLR v4 host; this does not change the mod target or establish game-Mono compatibility. Failures block publication. Future release titles use `Automated Public Transport Planning — Development Build`, with tags `Automated_Public_Transport_Planning-dev-<run_id>-<attempt>` and the approved eight-section installation/risk documentation. Historical diagnostic descriptions above do not describe the current all-push publication workflow. Editing existing bus routes remains unimplemented.

## Existing route editing — Development prototype

The new existing-route controls support both manual stop ordering/placement and automatic whole-route replacement from a selected planning proposal. Both modes preserve the existing line ID and stop count; the first implementation accepts complete ordinary Level1 city bus routes with three to six street stops only. It refuses fixed-platform originals and stop-count changes. This supersedes earlier statements that existing-route editing was unimplemented.

Enter the line ID and use original one-based indices (`1,3,2`) or captured segment-direction tokens (`f123,b456,3`) for a manual preview. Automatic mode takes a one-based planning proposal number with the same stop count. Road tokens and automatic mode require a fresh planning capture. Review the exact before/after preview, arm editing and confirm twice before the simulation-thread revalidation and MoveStop operations. A failed edit requests best-effort position recovery; it cannot guarantee atomic rollback or restore all simulation side effects. Use a save backup and inspect the full route afterwards. See the attached Development README for detailed usage.

Cloud model checks cover immutable input isolation, exact stale-route matching, line identity, unchanged counts and unsafe coordinate/site rejection. Successful cloud compilation and pure-data tests do not establish subscribed-game UI, MoveStop, connectivity or save/reload behavior. No stop insertion/deletion or line recreation is implemented.

### Edit failure and city-change handling

Queued edit operations now carry unique ownership tickets. City unload invalidates the old ticket, so an old preview, delayed check or completion cannot overwrite a new city's edit state. Before each apply or recovery write the operation verifies its request, managers, line identity and unchanged stop count.

Recovery skips already unchanged stops and reads back finite stop positions, count and route completeness after the line refresh. `PositionsRestored` means only that original positions were observed within 0.5 metres; it does not restore all passenger, vehicle or path side effects. `RecoveryIncomplete` requires inspection and restoring a save backup. `Invalidated` stops further writes after a city/request change. False or throwing native calls may already have modified the route, so return values alone are never treated as proof of recovery.

Cloud fault-injection checks exercise these control-flow cases against a fake route surface. They do not establish the real game's MoveStop, UI, connectivity or save/reload behavior.

### Manual input validation

Manual lists are limited to 128 characters and must contain exactly one comma-separated token per existing stop. Whitespace around tokens is allowed. Original indices must be positive and within the current stop count; `f`/`b` segment IDs must be 1–65535. Empty, signed, overflowing and normalized duplicate tokens (such as `f1,f001,3`) are refused before stop resolution. Opposite directions on one segment are separate tokens; the later physical-site validation may still reject overlapping stops. A road direction must have a captured anchorable lane. These syntax checks do not replace live-road, snapshot or confirmation safeguards.
